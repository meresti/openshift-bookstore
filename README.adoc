This demo project illustrates how to integrate OpenShift into the Jenkins pipeline; how to deploy the application to
OpenShift and then promote the image from one namespace to another (dev->test->prod) using a Jenkins Pipeline.

To create the OpenShift resources execute the PowerShell `openshift-env.ps1`
```
& ./openshift-env.ps1
```
In case script execution is disabled; it can be enabled for the current bash by executing the command
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```
